  <p>Learn how to use messaging technologies to build responsive and resilient applications for mobile devices and web browsers. With this hands-on guide, you’ll use the STOMP and MQTT messaging protocols to write iOS and web applications capable of sending and receiving GPS and device sensor data, text messages, and alerts.

  <p>Messaging protocols are not only simple to use, but also conserve network bandwidth, device memory, and batteries. Using this book’s step-by-step format, author <a href="/">Jeff Mesnil</a> helps you work with Objective-C and JavaScript libraries, as well as the protocols. All you need to get started are basic programming skills.

  <ul>
  <li>Understand basic messaging concepts and composition
  <li>Learn two common messaging models: point-to-point and publish/subscribe
  <li>Use STOMP to write an iOS application that sends GPS data, and a web app that consumes the data
  <li>Build an iOS app with MQTT that tracks and broadcasts device motion data, and a web app that displays the data and sends alerts
  <li>Extend STOMP to filter, prioritize, persist, and expire messages
  <li>Take a complete tour of STOMP and MQTT, including features not used in the book’s sample apps
  </ul>
