Our first child, Rapha&euml;l Mesnil, is born on September, 28^th at 52cm and 3.230kg.

Marion and the baby are fine and we enjoy every moment with him.

I am now a father which will make many photographs of his baby :)

I am already making good use of the Fujinon 56mm &#402;/1.2 lens that I bought a few months ago when we learnt that Marion was pregnant.

I am not accustomed to baby photography (or portraits in general) but this will change now that Rapha&euml;l is here.
We were back at home for one day and I was already setting up a studio to shoot his portrait.
Next step is to make photographs of Marion and the baby together.

So much fun, so much love.
