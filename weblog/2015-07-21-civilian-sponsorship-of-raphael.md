Earlier this month, we celebrated the civilian sponsorship<a id="fnr1-2015-07-21" href="#fn1-2015-07-21"><sup>1</sup></a> of our son, Rapha&euml;l.
It was a great sunny day full of laughs and emotion. 

Now our son has a godfather and godmother that will be there to take care of him.

I took this opportunity to create a story on [Exposure][exposure]. I learnt about this service from [Scott Kelby][kelby] and this
celebration was a good candidate to try this service.

You can read the story (in French) [here][exp-bapteme].

Exposure service is really good (I only used their free offer).
The image layout options are basic but good enough for such an image-oriented story. 
There is only one place where I would have preferred to use a grid layout with same size for all images.
I also would have liked more typography options to better distinguish the (sparse) text.

 [Scott Kelby's page][exp-kelby] provides some great examples of Exposure features.

I don't plan to upgrade to their pro offer but I'll keep playing with it as their offer improves.
