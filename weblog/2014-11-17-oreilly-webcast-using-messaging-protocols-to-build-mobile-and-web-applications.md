Last week, I made a [webcast for O'Reilly about using messaging protocols to build mobile and web applications][webcast] to promote my book, [Mobile & Web Messaging][mwm].

This webcast can be watched for free and you can also read the [slides][slides] I used for the presentation.
They contain most of the information I talked about during this 1-hour long webcast.

Thanks to the people at O'Reilly (and especially Yasmina Greco) to setup this presentation, it was a great and fun experience.
