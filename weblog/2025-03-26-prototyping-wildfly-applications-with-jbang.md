Yesterday was held the [WildFly mini conference - March 2025](https://www.wildfly.org/events/wmc-202503.html) where I presented how you can use [JBang](https://jbang.dev) to prototype Entreprise Java applications with [WildFly](https://wildfly.org).

The presentation was streamed on [YouTube WildFly channel](https://www.youtube.com/@WildFlyAS):

Unfortunately, the streaming was a bit compressed and made it difficult to read the code so you might be bettre looking at the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zHDrOnGjqREIw8ldEqU0mwXELgBVbbwqmadCVJAnSyg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) directly.

The conference was a great success. Don't hesitate to provide some [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfTM5f9VTW38CBdnU_XH_ngo-d4y-LvF6WP5dhzbSw28mqqQ/viewform) about the presentation and if you are interested to have similar content about the user experience improvements we are making around WildFly.
