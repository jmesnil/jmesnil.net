We spent the week-end near Roanne and visited Saint-Haon-le-Ch&acirc;tel, one of the smallest medieval town of France.

This town is located on the top of a hill. The church is at the very top of the town and offers a nice panorama view of the plain of Roanne.
The cemetary near the church was deserted, most graves were moved to a more recent cemetary and only remain a few tombstones and  ruins around a tree.
