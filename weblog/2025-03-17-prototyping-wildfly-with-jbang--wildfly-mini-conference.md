Next week, I'll talk about prototyping WildFly application with JBang at the [WildFly mini-conference](https://www.wildfly.org/events/wmc-202503.html) on March 25th.

[JBang](https://jbang.dev/) is a tool to create, edit and run self-contained source-only Java programs with unprecedented ease.
In this presentation, I will show how we can use JBang to prototype simple WildFly applications from a single Java source file. We start with a simple Web application and will prototype an AI chat bot.

The JBang integration was added to WildFly in [this proposal](http://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-proposals/user-experience/jbang.html) and you can already use it and learn about it from the [WildFly Glow documentation](https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-glow/#jbang).

The presentation will be done live on the [WildFly YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/live/d8IExBP7rxw). See you there!
