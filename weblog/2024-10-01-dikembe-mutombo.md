I learnt yesterday the sad news that Dikembe Mutombo passed away at the age of 58 from a brain cancer.

He started his career in 1991 as I got interested in the NBA. He was a great player to watch as I enjoy the defensive side of Basket ball.

I fondly remember when he fell down the floor after upsetting the Seattle SuperSonics of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp. That was the first time a 8<sup>th</sup> seed won against a 1<sup>st</sup> seed and his joy was contagious.

23 years later, I still have player cards from him that I scanned for this post.

Next time I play with my kids, I'll show them how he was wagging his finger when he blocked an opponent shot :)
