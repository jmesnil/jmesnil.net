Insightful portrait of Tim Duncan on the cusp of his 5th NBA finals (he won his first fours):
>Sometimes people will mention the swimming when trying to pinpoint the origin of Duncan’s remarkable discipline and relentless consistency. Duncan swam until he was 14 and seemed on a path toward the Olympics like his sister, Tricia. That was when Hurricane Hugo roared through the Island and wrecked the swimming pool. More, that was the year his mother, Ione, died of cancer. She had been his greatest fan, the loudest cheers at the pool, the voice inside his head. He would talk about the little nursery rhyme that she would repeat to him over and over and over …

> _Good, better, best_  
> _Never let it rest_  
> _Until your good is better_  
> _And your better is your best_

>You can’t help but think that if you cut Tim Duncan open, those words would be etched on his heart.

There has never been a basket-ball player so consistent for the whole span of his career ([stats per 36 minutes][stats]):

* 1st year - 21 year old, 19.4 points, 11 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 2.4 blocks, 57.7 true shooting %
* 7th year - 27 year old, 21.9 points, 12.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.6 blocks, 53.4 true shooting %
* 17th year - 36 year old, 21.3 points, 11.9 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 3.2, blocks, 55.4 true shooting %

I am rooting for the spurs for these finals! #GoSpursGo
