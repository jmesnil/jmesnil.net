On October 17th of last year, while playing basketball, I suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon.

Unfortunately, an initial misdiagnosis and a lengthy waitlist for necessary medical examinations resulted in me having to postpone surgery until December 9th.
The tendon rupture measured approximately 6cm, necessitating the use of tissue from adjacent areas of my feet to construct a completely new tendon.

This led to a period of immobilization lasting 45 days. Although the Christmas break was not particularly enjoyable, I consider myself fortunate to have an incredible wife and children who provided unwavering support, showering me with love and kindness throughout the ordeal.
My managers and colleagues at Red Hat were also very supportive so that I could focus on my health during that period.

When my boot was finally removed, I caught sight of my foot for the first time, revealing a 15cm scar that I could proudly boast about if I were on the "Jaws" boat :)

By the end of January, I cautiously began walking again, albeit with a noticeable limp. Since then, my rehabilitation has been a gradual journey with its fair share of ups and downs. Yesterday, I was able to run 5 km, but today climbing stairs causes discomfort.
I am hopeful that I will achieve a full recovery. As a symbolic "endpoint" to my rehab, I have set a goal to participate in a semi-marathon next year.

Although my competitive basketball days are over, I am still enthusiastic about playing with my kids and continuing to enjoy the sport. I'll play it less and watch it more :)
Walking, running, and hiking at my own pace have become my main physical activities, whether I'm by myself or accompanied by friends and family. They provide me  energy, focus and a deep appreciation of a functional body.
