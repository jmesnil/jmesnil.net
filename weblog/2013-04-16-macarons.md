Last month, my girlfriend offered me for my birthday a cooking class with a chef to make _macarons_. We already tried several times to make them without much success. The recipe is simple but not forgiving: one has to pay attention to a lot of details to cook macarons that please both the eyes and the palate.

This week-end, we had the cooking class with the chef and made _macarons garnis &agrave; la p&acirc;te d'amandes et au caramel au beurre sal&eacute;_

The chef was friendly and gave us lot of explanation to make the best macarons and we are quite happy with the results. They look good and taste even better!

We heartily recommend anyone in Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes, France who is interested to improve its cooking craftsmanship to take a class with Jean-Luc at [http://www.coachculinaire.fr][coach].
