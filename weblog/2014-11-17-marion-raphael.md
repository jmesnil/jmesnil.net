Over the week-end I experimented with portraits of Marion holding our baby, Rapha&euml;l.
I wanted to go for an intimate moment between a mother and her baby. The idea was to have a soft portrait of Rapha&euml;l and Marion wrapped in shadows.

Regardless of the darkness that surrounds them, their love is a bright light that will not be dimmed.

The end result looks like a chiaroscuro painting of La Vierge &agrave; l'Enfant.

### Technical (boring) corner

Technically, this is a simple photo with a soft light to preserve this private moment.

I used a one-light setup with a Yongnuo YN-560 III flash reflected by a [34" white umbrella][lastolite]. I positioned the flash at their right, at 45Â° above them.
The light is feathered so they only catch the edge of the light (retrospectively, I should have feathered it even more to increase the intimacy).

The background is a [40"x60" reflector][dynasun] with its black surface. Since the light is feathered, almost none reaches the black background and it remains pure black.

I positioned Marion so that Rapha&euml;l's face could catch most of the light and only her right side would be lit... plus a tiny bit of reflection on her left cheek thanks to the almost bald skull of our baby ;)

I used my Fuji X-E2 with its awesome 56mm &#402;/1.2 lens that I opened at &#402;/5.6 to have enough field of depth for both of them.

Rapha&euml; was intrigued by the flash tests and I just had to make a few pictures to capture this one.

Simple stuff, and a lovely moment that all three of us shared.
