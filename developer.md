I am employed by [Red Hat][redhat] as a _Senior Software Engineer_.

Currently, I am working for [JBoss][jboss], Red Hat's middleware division, on the [WildFly][wildfly] and [JBoss EAP][eap] application servers.
I am a member of the core team in charge of developing the internals of the application servers and lead its messaging subsystem (which provides the JMS API).

Previously, I also contributed to the [HornetQ][hornetq] messaging broker that is integrated into WildFly and EAP.

I am a proponent of Open Source development and all the code I write either professionally or privately is available under Open Source licenses.
These days, it is mostly hosted on [GitHub][github].

I have a keen interest on messaging systems and maintains several Open Source libraries related to messaging:

* [stomp.js][stompjs], a JavaScript client for STOMP (for Web browsers and node.js applications)
* [StompKit][stompkit], an Objective-C client for STOMP
* [MQTTKit][mqttkit], an Objective-C client for MQTT

I am avalaible to speak at conferences and JUGs about WildFly and messaging in general.
